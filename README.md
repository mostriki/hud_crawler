# HUD Crawler

##### Final capstone project exploring Ruby on Rails, 12.18.2017

##### By Riki Montgomery

### Description

The purpose of this project is to build an income source discrimination tracker to target localities in the states of Oregon and Washington, in order to advance legislation and legal recourse for low-income communities that are negatively affected. As of 2016 there were [42 jurisdictions](https://affordablehousingonline.com/source-of-income-antidiscrimination-laws) that prohibit discrimination against Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher holders. This application will be used as a proof of concept for non-profit legal aid providers in Oregon and [Oregon housing authorities](https://www.orhousingauthorities.org/) to assist those localities in the fight against income source discrimination. It has the added potential to help advocates, regulators, senators, city counselors, and members of congress advance legislation nationwide or make a case to affect change at a grassroots level by demonstrating the impact that this type of discrimination has on housing supply for low-income individuals while our cities struggle to address the housing crisis.

### Examples

[Example 1](https://eugene.craigslist.org/apa/d/great-duplex-avail-jan-1st/6411064407.html)
[Example 2](https://corvallis.craigslist.org/apa/d/3-bedroom-2-bath/6412158992.html)


### Further Exploration

- [] Compare cities, states, and counties with anti-income source discrimination laws against those without.

- [] Collect data from Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Vermont, and any other state with anti-discrimination laws.

- [] Create a form to collect data from other localities for grassroots organizers and legislators in those areas to affect change in those areas.

- [] Make the project open source.

- [] Google Maps API
